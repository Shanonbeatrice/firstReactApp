diference between props and states 
Props:
-inouts passed to a component 
-similar to funtion args 
-immutable ( you can change them but in react ikt -defeats the purpose and its not advised)
-causes a re-render of the component 

States:
-ata managed by the component 
-similar to local variables
-Mutable ( whole purpose is to change state of variables)
-causes a re-render
